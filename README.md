# GematriaCalculator
A very fast and efficient gematria calculator, for both Hebrew and Syriac, in C#. Also prints out useful unicode information for both Hebrew and Syriac, info that was key for writing this. Currently in one file to allow easy usage in other progs, but may change this if we want to add a console app etc.
